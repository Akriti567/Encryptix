            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Akriti Kumari Dev, an enthusiastic computer science student.
                My journey into computer science began with a fascination for technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Herald College Kathmandu. Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, and I enjoy building user-friendly web interfaces using HTML and CSS.
                Outside of my studies, I have actively participated in several extracurricular activities and projects. I have led multiple student projects, and volunteered for community service. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of effective communication, time management, and teamwork.
                In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I have a deep love for music, sports, and traveling.
                I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. My goal is to continue developing my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the field of technology and beyond.
