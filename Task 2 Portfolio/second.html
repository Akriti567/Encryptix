            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Akriti Kumari Dev, an enthusiastic computer science student.
                 My journey into computer science began with a 
                fascination for technology and its potential to 
                solve real-world problems. This passion led me 
                to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Herald College Kathmandu. Throughout my academic career,
                 I have developed a strong foundation in various programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, 
                 and I enjoy building user-friendly web interfaces using HTML and CSS.

                Outside of my studies, I have actively participated
            in several extracurricular activities and projects. I have led multiple student projects,  
            and volunteered for community service. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also 
            taught me the importance of effective communication, time management, and teamwork.

                In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I have a deep love for music, sports, 
                and traveling.

                I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. My goal is to continue developing my skills 
                and knowledge to make a positive impact in the field of technology and beyond.</p>

                    <h3>Course Management System</h3>
                    <p>I developed a comprehensive course management system as a project for my college
                         studies. This system allows students to register for 
                         courses, enroll in modules, and view their academic
                          progress. Administrators can manage course offerings,
                           add or cancel courses, and generate result slips
                            detailing student performance. Instructors can
                             view their assigned modules, record student marks,
                              and manage their teaching assignments. The system
                               persists data in a database, ensuring all information is securely stored and accessible across sessions.</p>
